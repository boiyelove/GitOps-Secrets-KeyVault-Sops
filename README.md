# GitOps-Secrets-KeyVault-Sops

Demonstrate safe encrypted-secret delivery for GitOps-managed AKS environments.

## Problem statement

An encrypted-secret delivery request maps a Git path and workload identity to Key Vault-backed decryption, rejecting plaintext values, public paths, unknown actions, and stale approvals.

A production implementation can still fail even when every resource deploys successfully. The material risk is apparently successful automation that lacks bounded scope, a reproducible denial path, or evidence operators can use during review and recovery. The design therefore treats Key Vault, Bicep, Argo CD, and the surrounding identity and evidence controls as one reviewable system rather than unrelated configuration tasks.

## Example case study

### Situation

Teams want pull-request-based GitOps but cannot commit plaintext production secrets. This engine keeps encrypted configuration reviewable in Git while limiting decryption to authorized workloads inside the cluster.

### Response

A GitOps team stores encrypted configuration in Git while keeping decryption authority in Azure. The reconciler uses workload identity to unwrap only its environment's material, and a developer without Key Vault access cannot turn ciphertext into plaintext.

The team first exercises the repository's synthetic approved and denied fixtures. An approved request must produce the same idempotent plan on replay; a stale, unscoped, public, or unapproved request must fail before an Azure adapter is allowed to run.

### Expected outcome

Stakeholders receive a decision package they can attach to a change record: requested scope, controls evaluated, the reason for approval or denial, and the explicit handoff to live integration. The example supports design review and incident rehearsal without pretending that a local test changed Azure.

## Architecture

SOPS encrypts repository values to controlled keys; Argo CD or Flux reconciles encrypted manifests while an in-cluster component, authorized by workload identity, obtains Key Vault material and decrypts only at the destination.

Primary services: `Key Vault`, `Bicep`, `Argo CD`, `Flux`, `SOPS`, `AKS`.

This repository implements the first production-oriented vertical slice: a
fail-closed, adapter-neutral control plane that validates tenant scope,
freshness, approvals, secretless identity, private access, and the exact
project action before producing a deterministic execution plan. Azure adapters
consume that plan; they are deliberately outside the local simulator so local
tests cannot claim a live cloud change occurred.

The upper boundary names the principal services and technologies used by this repository. The lower boundary shows the implemented control flow: desired state is validated, provider action remains an explicit integration gate, and sanitized evidence is retained for review and deterministic replay.

## Quickstart

Requirements: Python 3.11+ and Git. No Azure credentials are required.

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
python3 src/control_plane.py --request examples/approved-request.json
```

The command emits canonical JSON with a stable idempotency key. The denied
fixture exits with status 2 and explains the failed invariants.

## Security boundaries

- Managed identity or workload identity only; embedded credentials are denied.
- Public network access and stale evidence are denied.
- Production and break-glass targets require explicit approval.
- The IaC entry point is opt-in and defaults to deploying nothing.
- Evidence output contains identifiers and decisions, never credential values.

## Verification and limitations

Local validation covers 13 tests, deterministic replay, JSON parsing, Python
compilation, ignore hygiene, and Bicep compilation when a compiler is present.
It does **not** prove Azure deployment, service licensing, quota, data-plane
permissions, provider/API availability, cloud failover, load, cost, or teardown.
See [`docs/test-matrix.md`](docs/test-matrix.md) and [`docs/runbook.md`](docs/runbook.md) before any integration trial.

## Infrastructure inputs

Resource behavior and deploy-time values are intentionally separated:

- [Bicep template](infra/main.bicep) — Azure resources, modules, and security controls.
- [Bicep parameters](infra/main.bicepparam) — environment-specific names, regions, identities, and feature inputs.

Start with the parameter file's safe values, replace synthetic identifiers, and run an Azure what-if before deployment.
