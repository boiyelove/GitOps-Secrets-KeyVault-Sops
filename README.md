# GitOps-Secrets-KeyVault-Sops

Portfolio rank: **28**

Demonstrate safe encrypted-secret delivery for GitOps-managed AKS environments.

## Architecture

SOPS encrypts repository values to controlled keys; Argo CD or Flux reconciles encrypted manifests while an in-cluster component, authorized by workload identity, obtains Key Vault material and decrypts only at the destination.

Primary services: `Key Vault`, `Bicep`, `Argo CD`, `Flux`, `SOPS`, `AKS`.

This repository implements the first production-oriented vertical slice: a
fail-closed, adapter-neutral control plane that validates tenant scope,
freshness, approvals, secretless identity, private access, and the exact
project action before producing a deterministic execution plan. Azure adapters
consume that plan; they are deliberately outside the local simulator so local
tests cannot claim a live cloud change occurred.

```

## Quickstart

Requirements: Python 3.11+ and Git. No Azure credentials are required.

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
python3 src/control_plane.py --request examples/approved-request.json
```

The command emits canonical JSON with a stable idempotency key. The denied
fixture exits with status 2 and explains the failed invariants.

## Security boundaries

- Managed identity or workload identity only; embedded credentials are denied.
- Public network access and stale evidence are denied.
- Production and break-glass targets require explicit approval.
- The IaC entry point is opt-in and defaults to deploying nothing.
- Evidence output contains identifiers and decisions, never credential values.

## Verification and limitations

Local validation covers 12 tests, deterministic replay, JSON parsing, Python
compilation, ignore hygiene, and Bicep compilation when a compiler is present.
It does **not** prove Azure deployment, service licensing, quota, data-plane
permissions, provider/API availability, cloud failover, load, cost, or teardown.
See `docs/test-matrix.md` and `docs/runbook.md` before any integration trial.

## Community

See `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `SUPPORT.md`, and `LICENSE`. The reference
is intentionally conservative and uses synthetic identifiers only.
